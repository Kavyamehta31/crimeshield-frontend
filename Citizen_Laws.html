            <h2>About <strong>Citizen Laws</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Citizen Laws form the <strong>legal backbone</strong> of the Indian
                democratic system. They define who is a citizen, what rights they enjoy,
                and what duties they must perform under the
                <strong>Constitution of India</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A clear understanding of citizenship laws helps individuals exercise
                their <strong>fundamental rights</strong>, fulfill their
                <strong>constitutional duties</strong>, and cooperate effectively with
                <strong>law enforcement agencies</strong>.
